The Gardner
Tallest man on earth

[Verse]
I sense a runner in the garden
Although my judgements known to fail
Once built a steamboat in a meadow
Cos I'd forgotten how to sail

[Chorus]
I know the runner's going to tell you
There ain't no cowboy in my hair
So now he's buried by the daisies
So I could stay the tallest man in your eyes, babe

[Verse]
I sense a spy up in the chimney
From all the evidence I've burned
I guess he'll read it in the smoke now
And soon to ashes I'll return

[Chorus]
I know the spy is going to tell you
It's not my flag up in the pole
So now he's buried by the lilies
So I could stay forever more in your eyes, babe

[Verse]
I sense a leak inside my phone now
From all the lies I have told
I know he has your private number
And soon he'll make that vicious call

[Chorus]
I know the leak is going to tell you
There ain't no puppy in your leash
So now he'll fertilize the roses
So I could stay the king you see
In your eyes, babe

[Verse]
So now we're dancing through the garden
And what a garden I have made
And now that death will grow my jasmine
I find it soothing I'm afraid

[Chorus]
Now there is no need for suspicion
There ain't no frog kissing your hand
I won't be lying when I tell you
That I'm a gardner I'm a man
In your eyes bab

Superior
Tim Christensen

[Verse 1]
Superior
I just try to be superior
But I don't need to be superior
All you need is me
Perfectionist
I'm a bit of a perfectionist
But you don't want perfection
All you want is me

[Chorus]
I am terrified
Of what I might find
If I lose control
Of my very soul
Better understand
That I'm in command
When the fever breaks
I scramble to cover my mistakes
Scramble to cover my mistakes

[Verse 2]
Superior
I just try to be superior
But I don't need to be superior
All you need is me
The enemy
I treat you like my enemy
I keep my enemies close to me
All I want is you

[Chorus]
I am terrified
Of what I might find
If I lose control
Of my very soul
Better understand
That I'm in command
When the fever breaks
I scramble to cover my mistakes
Scramble to cover my mistakes

[Instrumental Solo]
All I want is you

[Chorus]
I am terrified
Of what I might find
If I lose control
Of my very soul
Better understand
That I'm in command
When the fever breaks
I scramble to cover my mistakes
I scramble to cover my mistakes

[Outro]
Superior
I just try to be superior
But I don't need to be superior
All I need is you

Creepin in
Nora Jones

[Verse]
There's a big old hole
Goes right through the sole
Of this old shoe
And the water on the ground
Ain't got no place else it's found
So it's only got one thing left to do

[Chorus]
Just creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

[Verse]
There's a silver moon
Came a little too soon
Oh, for me to bear
It shines brightly on my bed
And the shadows overhead
Won't let me sleep as long as it's there

[Chorus]
Just creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

[Verse]
There's a big old hole
Goes right through my soul
Oh, that ain't nothin' new
So as long as you're around
I got no place else you've found
There's only one thing left for you to do

[Chorus]
You just creep on in
Creep on in
And once you have begun
Don't stop until you're done
Sneakin' in

And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

Hey hey my my
Neil Young
Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye.
Hey hey, my my.

Out of the blue and into the black
You pay for this, but they give you that
And once you're gone, you can't come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black.

The king is gone but he's not forgotten
Is this the tale of Johnny rotten?
It's better to burn out than fade away
The king is gone but he's not forgotten.

Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye.
Hey hey, my my.

Why Georgia
John Mayer

[Verse 1]
I am driving up '85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life


[Chorus]
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

[Verse 2]
I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Either way--I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life
[Chorus]
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

[Bridge]
So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

[Verse 3]
Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Still "everything happens for a reason"
Is no reason not to ask myself

[Chorus]

Mrs Robinson
Simon & Garfunkel

[Intro]

[Chorus]
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo, wo, wo
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home


[Chorus]
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo, wo, wo
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids

[Chorus]
Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo, wo, wo
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Every way you look at it, you lose


[Chorus]
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you
Woo, woo, woo
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

O (Fly On)
Coldplay

[Verse 1]
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

[Verse 2]
And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

[Verse 3]
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following 'em up

[Verse 4]
Still, I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know, they're gone
They fly on
Fly on
Oh ohhhh

[Bridge]
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on

Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

[Pre-Chorus]
The green eyes
Yeah, the spotlight shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you

[Chorus]
I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you
And, honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes

Honey, you are the sea upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

And it feels so much lighter since I met you
And, honey, you should know that I could never go on without you

Till Kingdom Come
Coldplay

[Verse 1]
One... two...
Steal my heart... and hold my tongue
I feel my time... my time has come
Let me in... unlock the door
I never felt this way before

[Pre-Chorus]
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

[Verse 2]
Hold my head... inside your hands
I need someone... who understands
I need someone... someone who hears
For you I've waited all these years

[Chorus]
For you I'd wait... 'til Kingdom Come
Until my day... my day is done
And say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me

[Verse 3]
In your tears... and in your blood
In your fire... and in your flood
I hear you laugh... I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

[Pre-Chorus]
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I've become

For you I'd wait... 'til kingdom come
Until my days... my days are done
Say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me

Black Sun
Death Cab for Cutie

[Verse 1]
There is whiskey in the water
And there is death upon the vine
There is fear in the eyes of your father
And there is "yours" and there is "mine"

There is a desert veiled in pavement
And there's a city of seven hills
All our debris flows to the ocean
To meet again, I hope it will

[Chorus]
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?

[Verse 2]
There is an answer in a question
And there is hope within despair
And there is beauty in a failure
And there are depths beyond compare
There is a role of a lifetime
And there's a song yet to be sung
And there's a dumpster in the driveway
Of all the plans that came undone

[Chorus]
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?

[Verse 3]
There is whiskey in the water
And there is death upon the vine
And there is grace within forgiveness
But it's so hard for me to find

[Chorus]
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?

I Will Follow You Into The Dark
Death Cab for Cutie

[Verse 1]
Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind; I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

[Chorus]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse 2]
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son
Fear is the heart of love," so I never went back

[Chorus]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Bridge]
You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down; the time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

[Chorus]

Dust Bowl II
Other Lives

Land only for this fate
The skyline is not seen for many days
It feels as though
We're never turning back here
The land returns to the dust

[Chorus]
Is there any way, to get this weight off my skin
And find another one
Is there any one, to get this writing off the wall
And find a new one, and find

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like the wind blows into the great unknown
We're on our way, we are on our way
Moving west, may bring us better days
We're on our way, we are on our way

Is there any way, to get this weight off my skin
And find another one
Is there any one, to get this writing off the wall
And find a new one, and find

Oh babe, 
meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time

And oh babe, 
can you tell what's on my tongue?
Can you guess that I'll be gone?
With the twilight
With the twilight

[Chorus]
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, they say they don't

[Verse 2]
Oh babe, I've never been so lost
I wanna hear you lie
One last time
Just one last time

But oh babe, 
I really wish you would not cry
I only ever told you one lie
When it could have been a thousand
It might as well have been a thousand

[Chorus]
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, they say they don't

[Bridge]
And we can talk it round again girl
Round and round, round and round again
Or we could leave it out to die
Leave it out just leave it out
I never tried to trick you babe
I just tried to work it out
But I was swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
'Cause I just want to hold you tight
Without holding back my mind
Without holding back my mind

[Chorus]
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night

Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my

Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble Little Lion Man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother
Or else spend your days biting your own neck

[Chorus (Extended)]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?

[Verse 1]
Can you lie next to her
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body?

And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly?

And can you kneel before the king
And say, "I'm clean, I'm clean"?

[Chorus]
But tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

[Verse 2]
A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You desired my attention
But denied my affections, my affections

So tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

Lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life
Oh, lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life

I Gave You All
Mumford & Sons
[Verse]
Rip the earth in two with your mind
Seal the urge which ensues with brass wires
I never meant you any harm
But your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearm

[Pre-Chorus]
But close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile

[Verse]
How can you say that your truth is better than ours?
Shoulder to shoulder, now brother, we carry no arms
The blind man sleeps in the doorway, his home
If only I had an enemy bigger than my apathy I could have won

[Chorus]
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

[Pre-Chorus]
Close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile

[Chorus]
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I have
Just to say that you've won

And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I have
Just to say that you've won
You've won

Well now you've won

But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

Well now you've won
But I gave you all

Ooh La
The Kooks

[Verse 1]
In their eyes is a place that you finally discovered
That you love it here, you've got to stay
On this rock, not a rock, an island
On which you found a lover, then you twitch
You felt that itch in your petticoat
Your pretty, pretty petticoat
Then you smiled, he got wild
You didn't understand that there's money to be made
Beauty is a card that must get played
By organisations

[Chorus]
Well, ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out
And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out

The world can be a very big place
So be yourself, don't feel out of place
Love your man and love him twice
Go to Hollywood and pay the price
Oh, go to Hollywood
And don't be a star, it's such a drag
Take care of yourself, don't begin to lag
It's a hard life to live, so live it well
I'll be your friend and not to pretend I know you, girl
In all situations

[Chorus]
And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
Well, ooh la, the world just chewed her up and spat her out
And ooh la, she was such a good girl to me

So at my show on Monday, I was hoping someday
You'd be on your way to better things
It's not about your make-up or how you try to shape up
To these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey
So now you pour your heart out, you're telling me you're far out
But not about to lie down for your cause
But you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man moving on to better things

[Chorus]
Well, uh-oh, oh, I love her because she moves in her own way
Well, uh-oh, oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day

[Verse 2]
And at the show on Tuesday, she was in her mind, see
Tempered furs and spangled boots
Looks are deceiving, make me believe it
And these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey, yeah
So won't you go far, tell them you're a keeper
Not about to lie down for your cause
And you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man moving on to better things

Yes, I wish that we never made it there through all the summers
And kept them up instead of kicking us back down to the suburbs
Yes, I wish that we never made it there through all the summers

How could this be done

Is such an ugly word for something so beautiful
Oh, that every time I look inside

I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be, well, she's still out to get me
And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking

On the seaside, in the seaside

Hey! Uh
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it
Listen

[Verse 1]
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey!

[Chorus]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh

[Post-Chorus]
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it
Yeah

[Verse 2]
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
Well, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
Hey!

After hours of motionless dancing
To the sound of heavy rain
I told myself to pick up the pieces
And go moving on up again
I'll let it just drip-drip-drip on me

That's what I told you from the start
Oooooh

When I was just a young child
My father said to me
He said sleep around with dogs, dear
And you for sure will catch their fleas
Well, your itchiness well suits me
And your boldness makes me smile
I guess I'll just stay a little longer
I guess I'll just give you a try

Oooooh
It will get better
That's what I told you from the start

Enjoy the Silence

Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

They can only do harm

Enjoy the silence

Princes
Oscar & the Wolf
[Intro]
And I don't know what you're gonna do
Don't know about me
One, two, three, let's go

[Verse 1]
Tell me when you want me too
So get around me

[Post-Verse]
So run for the gold, run for the money
Run for the infinity
We'll never return and be free
But every time that I come around
There's too many little things they know about us
No, I can't play

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna be your friend, babe
There's no other way
I'm the one so baby don't pretend
And I don't wanna make it bad so
There's no other way
I don't want you to make me mad

[Chorus]
Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over. Tight
Got my boys in the water
Got my boys in the water

Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over. Tight
Got my boys in the water
Got my boys in the water

[Verse 2]
Then we fall in the replay
For the night calling
Where princes rule the world
The party ain't jumping
But we should get lost before you
[Post-Verse]
So run for the gold, run for the money
Run for the infinity
We'll never return and be free
But every time that I come around
There's too many little things they know about us
No, I can't play

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna be your friend, babe
There's no other way
I'm the one so baby don't pretend
And I don't wanna make it bad so
There's no other way
I don't want you to make me mad

[Chorus]
Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over. Tight
Got my boys in the water
Got my boys in the water

Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over. Tight
Got my boys in the water
Got my boys in the water

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna be your friend, babe
There's no other way
I'm the one so baby don't pretend
And I don't wanna make it bad so
There's no other way
I don't want you to make me mad

[Chorus]
Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over. Tight
Got my boys in the water
Got my boys in the water (repeat)

Blue Ridge Mountains
Fleet Foxes

[Intro]
Lie down with me my dear, lie down
Under stormy night, tell nobody

[Verse 1]
My brother, where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee

[Verse 2]
You're ever welcome with me any time you like
Let's drive to the countryside, leave behind some green-eyed look-a-likes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no

[Interlude]
But Sean, don't get careless
I'm sure it'll be fine
I love you, I love you
Oh, brother of mine

[Chorus]
In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest
And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

[Post-Chorus]
Terrible am I, child?
Even if you don't mind

[Chorus]
In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest
And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

[Post-Chorus]
Terrible am I, child?
Even if you don't mind, no

That funny feeling
Bo Burnham

[Verse 1]
Stunning 8K resolution meditation app
In honor of the revolution, it's half-off at the Gap
Deadpool's self-awareness, loving parents, harmless fun
The backlash to the backlash to the thing that's just begun

[Chorus]
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

[Verse 2]
The surgeon general's pop-up shop, Robert Iger's face
Discount Etsy agitprop, Bugles' take on race
Female Colonel Sanders, easy answers, civil war
The whole world at your fingеrtips, the ocean at your door
The livе-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show
Twenty-thousand years of this, seven more to go
Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul
A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall

[Chorus]

 [Verse 3]
Reading Pornhub's terms of service, going for a drive
And obeying all the traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto V
Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown
A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone
Total disassociation, fully out your mind
Googling "derealization," hating what you find
That unapparent summer air in early fall
The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
You wait
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
Just wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da
(repeat)

[Verse]
I don't know what to do with you
Buy let's play a game not meant to win or lose
You hold a key to some degree
A path to finally being somewhat free (Fi-Na-Ly triplets)

You Know The truth
Wolftrap

[Verse]
I only seek a sense of truth
When you come up I feel connected to
The only thing we care about
That's deep inside our hidden third eye

[Pre Chorus]
Oh don't you see
What you do with me / you belong with me

[Pre Chorus]
Open the gates
Make your mistakes

[Chorus]
I don't know anything
but you, you do
I don't know what is true
but you, you do
I don't know what the hell is true
you know the truth
You show me how to skip the blues
You know the truth

I thank us both for what we've done
what you do o o

Cherry Wine
Hozier

[Verse]
Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh but she burns
Like rum on the fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire.

[Pre Chorus]
It looks ugly, but it's clean,
Oh momma, don't fuss over me.
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine

[Chorus]
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine.

[Verse]
Calls of guilty thrown at me
All while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully
Just like she throws with the arm of her brother.

[Pre Chorus]
But I want it
It's a crime
That she's not around most of the time.
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine

[Chorus]
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
Blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine.

[Verse]
Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful
I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing.

[Pre Chorus]
And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time.
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine

[Chorus]
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine.

Make it with chu
Queens of the Stone Age


You wanna know if I know why
I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil eye
Or how one becomes two
I just can't recall what started it all
Or how to begin in the end
I ain't here to break it
Just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again
I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit' chu
Anytime, anywhere
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu
Sometimes the same is different
But mostly it's the same
These mysteries of life
That just ain't my thing
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon
I'd be untrue
The only thing I know for sure
Is what I wanna do
Anytime, anywhere, and I said
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu
Anytime, anywhere
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu
I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit' chu
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu
I wanna make it
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit' chu
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu
(Again and again, and again, and again)
I wanna make it

You’ve got a friend in me
Randy Newman

You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me

Yeah, you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You got troubles, I've got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and see it through
'Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you
The way I do
It's me and you, boy

And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

You’re gonna live forever in me
John Mayer

A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately
But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see

Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat
But you're gonna live forever in me
I'll guarantee, just wait and see

City of Stars
La La Land

[Sebastian:]
City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you

[Mia:]
That now our dreams may finally come true

City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else

[Sebastian:]
A rush
[Mia:]
A glance
[Sebastian:]
A touch
[Mia:]
A dance

[Both:]
A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, I'll be here
And you'll be alright

I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart

[Sebastian:]
Think I want it to stay

City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars

[Mia:]
You never shined so brightly

Fix you
Coldplay

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above, or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes

Tears stream down your face, and I
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks

Hey Wait I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey Wait I got a new complaint

Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called Yellow

So, then I took my turn
What a thing to've done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn in to something beautiful
Do you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
What a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
What a thing to do
And it was all yellow

And your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn in to something beautiful
Do you know
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
It's true
Look how they shine for you

Out of hand

I don't want to know your name
And i know you will feel the
Same way
Yes i know it's going to rain
Some things never change

No i do not have a smoke
And i don't want to hear your
Jokes
In fact i'd rather see you bleed
So just let me be

Won't you just get off my back
It's such a simple way to leave
It at that
Or the world will understand
I'm happiest when things get out
Of hand

No I will not read your book
And I think you're something of
A crook
How about you get clever and
Remember why I like to be free
Free to disagree

Won't you just get off my back
It's such a simple way to leave
It at that
Or the world will understand
I'm happiest when things get out
Of hand

Yeah what life keeps cool
And I believe they only ? that life is short

Do you remember when
Nobody knew me ? so simple then
Ooh what you knew my name,
And I know they will never ? the same again

I will stay with you

How I needed you

How I needed you
How I needed you

Well a long time ago
That night we have was my only claim to fame
Yeah we will run we're friend
And girl, you took a way from us,
Our happy end

I will stay with you 
I will stay with you 
I will stay with you 
How I needed you 
How I needed you 
How I needed you

Taken from the everything in the world
(I needed you)
Because
I hate you more than I hate everything in the world
Well I do, I said I do

You've taken from me everything I deserve
Well it's true, I said it's true
I hate you more than I hate everything in the world
Well I do, I said I do


You've taken from me everything I deserve
Well it's true, I said it's true
Taken from the everything in the world

I will stay with you 
I will stay with you

Lili, take another walk out of your fake world
Please put all the drugs out of your hand
You'll see that you can breathe without no back up
So much stuff you got to understand


For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide
For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide


Lili, you know there's still a place for people like us
The same blood runs in every hand
You see it's not the wings that make the angel
Just have to move the bats out of your head


For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide
For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide


And Lili, easy as a kiss we'll find an answer
Put all your fears back in the shade
Oh don't become a ghost without no colour
'Cause you're the best paint life ever made


For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide
For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide
I'll be your guide
I'll be your guide


Lili, you know there's still a place for people like us
The same blood runs in every hand
You see it's not the wings that make the angel
Just have to move the bats out of your head


For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought

I'll be your guide
I'll be your guide

Take me Home
John Denver

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads


All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye


Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads


I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday


Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads


Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, (down) country roads
Take me home, (down) country roads

Walk the Line
Johnny Cash
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line


I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line


As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line


You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line


I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Boulevard of Broken Dreams

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone


I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone


I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-


[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone


[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah


[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone


Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone


I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-
 
[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

I'm the one that drives away, follows you back home
I, I'm a street light shining
I'm a white light blinding bright, burning off and on
Uh-huh


It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again

I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
But I, I'm a little divided
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind?
Uh-huh


It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again

My Hero
Foo Fighters
Too alarming now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary


Kudos, my hero
Leaving all the mess
You know my hero
The one that's on


There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero

Sound of Silence
Simon & Garfunkel
Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence


In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence


And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence


"Fools," said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you."
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence


And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence."

Maybe It’ Time
Bradley Cooper
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change a man
Hell, it takes a lot to try
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die


Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Some folks just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read
Nobody knows what awaits for the dead


I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from
I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
But if I could take spirits from my past and bring 'em here
You know I would
Know I would


Nobody speaks to God these days
Nobody speaks to God these days
I'd like to think he's lookin' down and laughin' at our ways
Nobody speaks to God these days


When I was a child, they tried to fool me
Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was real
Well I've seen Hell in Reno
And this world's one big old Catherine wheel
Spinnin' steel


Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change your plans
And a train to change your mind
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Oh, maybe it's time to let the old ways die

While my guitar gently wheeps
The Beatles


I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps


I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you


I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps


I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you


I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

Imagine
John Lennon


[Verse 1]
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
I


[Verse 2]
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You


[Chorus]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one


[Verse 3]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You


Chorus]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

The man who sold the world
Nirvana




[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago


[Chorus] (C F C# F C F C# A)
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world


[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago




[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world


[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

When You Break
Bears Den
[Verse 1]
Spoilt, selfish, little child
Went out to play out in the wild
We found you shaking like a leaf
Underneath your family tree


[Verse 2]
You could never live out in the open
Regretting every word you've spoken
When you break, it's too late for you to fall apart
And the blame that you claim is all your own fault


[Chorus]
And you've been crying now for forever
But forever's come and gone
You keep begging for forgiveness
But you don't think you've done wrong
You've been crying now for forever
But forever's come and gone
My pleading hands, your shaking head


[Verse 3]
As your love starts to surround you
All of their words are trying to drown you
So you break, it's too late for you to fall apart
And the blame that you claim is all your own fault


[Chorus]
But you've been crying now for forever
But forever's come and gone
You keep begging for forgiveness
But you don't think you've done wrong
You've been crying now for forever
But forever's come and gone
My pleading hands, your shaking head

[Bridge]
So tell me another beautiful lie
Tell me everything that I want to hear
Oh won't you lay here by my side
I want to fuck away all my fear [Repeat]

[Outro]
For I have seen all that you have seen
And I have been where you have been
No, our hands may never be clean
At least we can hold each other
At least we can hold each other

Dust Bowl Dance
Mumford & Sons
[Verse 1]
The young man stands on the edge of his porch
The days were short, and the father was gone
There was no one in the town, and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield

[Verse 2]
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart will never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse


[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time




[Verse 3]
Well, you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has, and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves, you know not what is in store


[Verse 4]
There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you've always denied
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"


[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time


[Interlude]


[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time




[Interlude]


[Chorus 2]
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes, it was me
I know what I've done, cause I know what I've seen
I went out back, and I got my gun
I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"

Sitting Waiting Wishing
Jack Johnson

[Verse 1]
Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
But lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the lord, no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you


[Chorus 1]
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

[Verse 2]
I sang your songs, I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them wasn't worth never having you
Ah, maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

[Chorus 2]
I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool


[Bridge 1]
I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down


[Bridge 2]
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting




[Verse 3]
Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long
But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do


[Chorus 1]
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?


[Chorus 2]
No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool


[Outro]
Fool, hm hm

You Don’t Know
Milow

[Verse 1]
Sometimes everything seems awkward and large
Imagine a Wednesday evening in March
Future and past at the same time
I make use of the night, start drinking a lot
Although not ideal for now it's all that I've got
It's nice to know your name

[Chorus 1]
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know anything 'bout me




[Verse 2]
An ocean, a lake, I need a place to drown
Let's freeze the moment because we're going down
And tomorrow you'll be gone, gone, gone
You're laughing too hard, this all seems surreal
I feel peculiar, now, what do you feel?
Do you think there's a chance that we can fall?


[Chorus 2]
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know anything about me
"What do I know?" I know your name
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know anything about me
Anymore


[Bridge]
I gave up dreaming for a while
I gave up dreaming for a while


[Verse 2]
I've noticed these are mysterious days
I look at it like a jigsaw puzzle and gaze
With wide open mouth and burning eyes
If only I could start to care
My dreams and my Wednesdays ain't going nowhere
Baby, baby, baby you don't know

Misguided Ghosts
Paramore

I am going away for a while
But I'll be back don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible


See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes


And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction


'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Travelin' endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles


But now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it


Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds
So I can find someone to rely on?


And run to them, to them
Full-speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless
We are just


Misguided ghosts
Travelin' endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
And we should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
They echo me in circles

U-turn (Lilly)
Aaron
Lili, take another walk out of your fake world
Please put all the drugs out of your hand
You'll see that you can breath without no back up
So much stuff you got to understand


For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide


For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide


Lili, you know there's still a place for people like us
The same blood runs in every hand
You see it's not the wings that make the angel
Just have to move the bats out of your head


For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide


For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide


Lili, easy as a kiss we'll find an answer
Put all your fears back in the shade
Don't become a ghost without no colour
'Cause you're the best paint life ever made


For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide


For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
And I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I'll wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?

Trouble
Coldplay

Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no what's this
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turn to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done


And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm


Oh no, I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble


Singing that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm


They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

Love is all
The Tallest Man On Earth
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your will is in my hand
Oh, your will is in my hand


And I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
Oh, mine has learned to kill


Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go


And now spikes will keep on falling from the heavens to the floor
The future was our skin and now we don't dream anymore
No, we don't dream anymore


Like a house made from spider webs and the clouds rolling in
I bet this mighty river's both my savior and my sin
Oh, my savior and my sin


Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go


Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your strength is in my hand
Your strength is in my hand


And I'll throw you in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
Oh, mine has learned to kill


Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go

Bohemian Rhapsody
Queen
Is this the real life? 
Is this just fantasy? 
Caught in a landside 
No escape from reality 
Open your eyes 
Look up to the skies and see


I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy 
Because I'm easy come, easy go 
Little high, little low 
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me (to me)


Mama 
Just killed a man 
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger 
Now he's dead 
Mama, life had just begun 
But now I've gone and thrown it all away


Mama, oo-oo-oo 
Didn't mean to make you cry 
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow 
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters


Too late, my time has come 
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time 
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go 
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth


Mama, oo-oo-oo (the wind blows) 
I don't want to die 
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all


I see a little silhouetto of a man 
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango?


Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me 
Galileo, Galileo 
Galileo, Galileo 
Galileo, Figaro, magnifico, oh-oh-oh


I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me 
He's just a poor boy from a poor family 
Spare him his life from this monstrosity


Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? 
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go 
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go 
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go


(Let me go) will not let you go 
(Let me go) never let you go 
(Let me go) (never) let you go (let me go) 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no


Oh, mama mia, mama mia (mama mia, let me go) 
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me 
For me


So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye 
So you think you can love me and leave me to die 
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby 
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here


Oo-oo 
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah


Nothing really matters, anyone can see 
Nothing really matters 
Nothing really matters to me


Any way the wind blows

Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry 
You don't know how lovely you are 
I had to find you, tell you I need you


Tell you I set you apart 
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions 
Oh, let's go back to the start


Running in circles, coming up tails 
Heads on a science apart 
Nobody said it was easy


It's such a shame for us to part 
Nobody said it was easy 
No one ever said it would be this hard


Oh, take me back to the start 
I was just guessing at numbers and figures 
Pulling the puzzles apart 
Questions of science, science and progress


Do not speak as loud as my heart


But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me 
Oh and I rush to the start 
Running in circles, chasing our tails


Coming back as we are 
Nobody said it was easy 
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part 
Nobody said it was easy 
No one ever said it would be so hard 
I'm going back to the start 
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ah ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

I have lived in darkness
For all my life, I've been pursued
You'd be afraid if you could feel my pain
And if you could see the things I am able to see


Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free


I hail from the dark side
For all my life, I've been besieged
You'd be scared living with my despair
And if you could feel the things, I am able to feel


Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free
Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free
Save me from the dark side
Break me out, break me out
Set me free

Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people!

Mad World
Tears for Fears
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere


Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow


And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world, mad world


Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen


Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me


And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world, mad world


Enlarging your world
Mad world

Ain’t no sunshine
Bill Withers

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
It's not warm when she's away 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And she's always gone too long 
Anytime she's goes away


Wonder this time where she's gone 
Wonder if she's gone to stay 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away


And I know, I know, I know, I know 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

But ain't no sunshine when she's gone, whoa, whoa


Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Only darkness every day 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away


Anytime she goes away 
Anytime she goes away 
Anytime she goes away

I’m a Believer
The Monkees

[Verse 1]
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else, but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams


[Chorus 1]
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried


[Verse 2]
I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave, the less I got
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine, I got rain


[Chorus 1]
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried


[Solo]


[Bridge]
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams


[Chorus 1]
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried


[Chorus 2]
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
And I'm a believer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a believer

Cold Little Heart
Michael Kiwanuka

[Verse 1]
Did you ever want it?
Did you want it bad?
Ohhh, my
It tears me apart
Did you ever fight it?
All of the pain
So much pride
Running through my veins


[Pre-Chorus]
Bleeding, I'm bleeding
My cold little heart
Oh I, I can't stand myself


[Chorus]
And I know
In my heart, in this cold heart
I can live or I can die
I believe if I just try
You believe in you and I
In you and I
In you and I
In you and I


[Verse 2]
Did you ever notice
I've been ashamed?
All my life
I've been playing games
We can try to hide it
It's all the same
I've been losing you
One day at a time


[Pre-Chorus]
Bleeding, I'm bleeding
My cold little heart
Oh I, I can't stand myself


[Chorus]
And I know
In my heart, in this cold heart
I can live or I can die
I believe if I just try
You believe in you and I
In my heart, in this cold heart
I can live or I can die
I believe if I just try
You believe in you and I
In you and I (7x)


[Outro]
Maybe this time I can be strong
But since I know who I am
I'm probably wrong
Maybe this time I can go far
But thinking about where I've been
Ain't helping me start

Creep
Radiohead
When you were here before 
Couldn't look you in the eye

You're just like an angel 
Your skin makes me cry 
You float like a feather 
In a beautiful world

I wish I was special 
You're so fuckin' special


But I'm a creep 
I'm a weirdo 
What the hell am I doin' here? 
I don't belong here


I don't care if it hurts 
I wanna have control 
I want a perfect body 
I want a perfect soul 
I want you to notice 
When I'm not around


So fuckin' special 
I wish I was special


But I'm a creep 
I'm a weirdo 
What the hell am I doin' here? 
I don't belong here


She's running out the door (run) 
She's running out 
She run, run, run, run


Run


Whatever makes you happy 
Whatever you want


You're so fuckin' special


I wish I was special


But I'm a creep 
I'm a weirdo 
What the hell am I doin' here? 
I don't belong here 
I don't belong here

Karma Police
Radiohead
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party


This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us


Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll


This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us


For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself

Eleonor Rigby
The Beatles
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!


[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?


[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?


[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?


All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?


[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!


[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved


[Outro: Paul McCartney]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?

Get lucky
Daft Punk
Like the legend of the phoenix, huh 
All ends with beginnings 
What keeps the planet spinning, ah 
The force from the beginning, hm, look


We've come too far 
To give up who we are 
So let's raise the bar 
And our cups to the stars


She's up all night 'til the sun 
I'm up all night to get some 
She's up all night for good fun 
I'm up all night to get lucky 
We're up all night 'til the sun 
We're up all night to get some 
We're up all night for good fun 
We're up all night to get lucky


We're up all night to get lucky 
We're up all night to get lucky 
We're up all night to get lucky 
We're up all night to get lucky


The present has no ribbon 
Your gift keeps on giving 
What is this I'm feeling? 
If you wanna leave I'm with it, ah


We've come too far 
To give up who we are 
So let's raise the bar 
And our cups to the stars


She's up all night 'til the sun 
I'm up all night to get some 
She's up all night for good fun 
I'm up all night to get lucky 
We're up all night 'til the sun 
We're up all night to get some 
We're up all night for good fun 
We're up all night to get lucky


We're up all night to get lucky 
We're up all night to get lucky 
We're up all night to get lucky 
We're up all night to get lucky
